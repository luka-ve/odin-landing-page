# Oding landing page

This is my take on the [landing page project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/landing-page) from the The Odin Project.

I thought the generic page was pretty dull, so now it displays our dog in all his autumn glory. I also added custom CSS properties so I can reference the same colors all over the page.
